# ShellSortSequences
This project is about Shell Sort algorithm. We analyze how the sequence given affects its efficiency.

In the Q1, it was used the floor(N/2^k) sequence, where N is the List Size.

In the Q2, it was used the Ciura sequence characterize by the initial terms 1, 4, 10, 23, 57, 132, 301, 701 and for bigger numbers than 701, is used the recurrence hk = floor(2.25hk-1).
